    "There is a lack of affordable access to many important medications in the Arab world. Some of these medicationsa are available in neighboring countries at reasonable prices. If these medications can be distributed effectively taking advantage of existing transport between the countries, then these crucial medications can be made more plentiful and affordable. To minimize the cost of medications and take advantage of this opportunity for arbitrage, transport of medications from airports to consumers must be as efficient as possible. We solve this problem as a vehicle routing problem where the objective is to minimize the overall cost of deliveries given a fleet of vehicles with limited capacities. We formulate this as a VQE algorithm which is solved using quantum annealing with D-Wave's superconducting hardware."
