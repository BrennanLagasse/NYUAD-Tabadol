There is a lack of affordable access to many important medications in the Arab world. Some of these medicationsa are available in neighboring countries at reasonable prices. If these medications can be distributed effectively taking advantage of existing transport between the countries, then these crucial medications can be made more plentiful and affordable. 
Our solution has three components.

First, we developed an app that informs travelers of medications in need in the region and allows users in need of medication to make requests.

Next, there are many constraints on travelers on what medications they can travel with as well as space and weight constraints in terms of what they can add to luggage. Certain medications may also be needed more urgently than others. When there are many people in need of medication and many medications in the system, this optimization problem is complex. We can solve this problem as a knapsack problem on quantum hardware.

Finally, to minimize the cost of medications and take advantage of this opportunity for arbitrage, transport of medications from airports to consumers must be as efficient as possible. We solve this problem as a vehicle routing problem where the objective is to minimize the overall cost of deliveries given a fleet of vehicles with limited capacities. We formulate this as a VQE algorithm which is solved using quantum annealing with D-Wave's superconducting hardware.
